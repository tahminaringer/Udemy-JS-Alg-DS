// write a function which takes two numbers and returns their sum

// 1. can you restate the problem in your own words?
//write a function that adds two numbers
// 2. What are the inputs
// how large are the numbers? Are they integers? Are we only working with two inputs?
// 3. What are the outputs
// is it an integer, float, string, etc ?
// 4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? Do you have enough information to solve the problem
// what happens if someone only passes in one number? edgecases
// 5. How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?
